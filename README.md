# Esp8266_Screen_Webserver
Send text from a WebServer to your Esp8266 and display it on a OLED screen

This project allows you to change what is displayed on the screen of an esp8266 via a website. 
 
1. Start by configuring the Wi-Fi settings in the code, which can be done on line 8 and line 9 by replacing what is inside the quotation marks with your own Wi-Fi settings. 
2. Once that is done, you can upload the code to your esp8266. 
3.When the upload is complete, the OLED screen should light up with an IP address that you need to enter in a web browser to access the website. 
4.On the website, you can enter whatever you want in a text box and then click Update. 
5.Once you have clicked Update, the text on the OLED screen should change to what you typed within a few seconds.
